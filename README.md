# Three Pulsing Led
An Arduino sketch for three LED pulsing in turn, repeatedly. 
A progression from [Arduino's blinking LED example](http://arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Blink?from=Tutorial.BlinkingLED):

### Background
A small progression from Arduino 101 during [Space Town Hall's co-learn classes](http://www.spacetownhall.com/learn.html) to illustrate:
* using more than 1 LED
* controlling brightness
* basic soldering skills
